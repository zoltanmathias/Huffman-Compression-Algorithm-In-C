# Huffman-Compression-Algorithm-In-C

The purpose of Huffman coding is to achieve lossless data compression. This algorithm creates tree nodes and allocates the most common character at the base of the tree and so forth. This reduces the size of any input or file tremendously.

 This project was completed for the SFWRENG 4J03 Communication Systems course at McMaster University in the winter semester of 2017.
